		<p>Concentration, also known as Match Match, Memory, Pelmanism, Shinkei-suijaku, Pexeso or simply Pairs, is a card game in which all of the cards are laid face down on a surface and two cards are flipped face up over each turn. The object of the game is to turn over pairs of matching cards.</p>
	<h2 id="game">Why this game?</h2>
		<p>Concentration is a fun game that not only allows you to test your memory, but also gives you the opportunity to see how your memory stands up against those of your opponents. Train your brain while playing this game alone, and then play with friends and blow them away with your incredible skills of recollection!</p>
